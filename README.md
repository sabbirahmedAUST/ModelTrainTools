# Model Train Helping Tools
For training a model, sometimes it keeps getting disconnected. To prevent this, a python code [click,py][clk] is added. It will auto click after 3 minutes interval. So, your colab will never be in run- time disconnected.Just create a blank code window,click your cursor there until the time process completese.
